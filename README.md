# Classification-Analysis-for-Apprentice-Chef-Inc.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine which customers will subscribe to the promotion.

In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines.

Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received, and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. This project will develop top insights, and building a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.

Please see the analysis file for the thought process and walkthrough of the analysis. I also included the pdf file of the insights and recommendations from the analysis.
